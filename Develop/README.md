# Password Generation Station

  ![License Badge](https://img.shields.io/badge/license-MIT-blue)

  ## Description
  This webpage serves as a password generator. When you click "Generate" you will be prompted to choose how many characters, between 8 and 128, that the final password will be. This will then trigger prompts asking the user which criteria they would like to include in the final output. The final password can include lowercase characters, uppercase characters, numbers, and/or special characters. If no criteria is selected then the function will return and if a number between 8 and 128 is not chosen then the function will return.

  ## Usage
  When you click the red generate button it triggers a prompt that asks the user to enter a number between 8 and 128. If you enter a number less than 8 or greater than 128 then  the function will return. Following this prompt, the user will be asked to confirm if they would like to include lowercase characters, uppercase, numeric, and/or special characters. The function will then push the selected criteria values from each variable into the possible characters variable. The generatePassword function then uses a for loop to create a random password.
